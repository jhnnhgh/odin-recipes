    <h1>Johann's Gormet Burgers</h1>
    <p>This is the best turkey burger recipe. After making them the first time my husband said "no more" to beef burgers. These are really good â€” any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also be used for meatballs or meatloaves.</p>

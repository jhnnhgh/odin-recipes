    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low. Let the sauce simmer while you prepare the rest of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a small amount of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of sauce and a final sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
